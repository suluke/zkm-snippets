# ZKM Snippets
A static website displaying important pieces of code from our particles project displayed at ZKM's Open Codes exhibition

## Development
You have 2 options for building the site:
1. Use `make` for building the site and serve the `build` directory using any static file server you like, or
2. Start the dev server by running `npm start` (or alternatively `make server`) and navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

The second option has the advantage that you will only need to reload the page for changes to take effect.
