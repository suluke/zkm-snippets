# ZKM Snippets
A static website displaying important pieces of code from our particles project displayed at ZKM's Open Codes exhibition

## Development
As the first step, you need to initialize the npm packages needed for building.
Therefore, execute `npm i` from the project's base directory.
Afterwards, you will have 2 options for building and viewing the site:
1. Use `make` for building the site and open `build/index.html` in your browser or
2. Start the dev server by running `npm start` and navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

The second option has the advantage that you will only need to reload the page for changes to take effect.
